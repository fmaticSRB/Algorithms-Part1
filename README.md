## General Info
This repo contains the files and assignment submissions for the course:
Algorithms, Part I by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick of Princetion
University. 

Each week covered a different aspect of Algorithms and Data Structures. 
The files contain the source material for each assignment, as well as the
libraries used for the course. Each assignment was submitted using a .zip
format, which is incluced in the "Results" folder. 

## Technologies
All code created using Java Version 12, 2019-03-19
Java (TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 12+33)

## Project Description
* Week 1 - Percolation

   Created a program that estimates the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo Simulation
* Week 2 - Randomized Queues and Deques

   Implemented elementary data structures using arrays and linkedlists.
* Week 3 - Pattern Recognition

   Create a program that recognizes line patterns in a given set of points
* Week 4 - 8 Puzzle

   Created a program that solves the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* Search algorithm
* Week 5 - Kd-Trees

   Created a data type that represents a set of points in a unit square using a 2d-tree.
